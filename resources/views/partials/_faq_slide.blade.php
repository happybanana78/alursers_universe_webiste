        <b class="text-3xl text-slate-900">WHAT IS AN NFT?</b>
        <p class="text-2xl text-light mt-3">NFTs ("Non-Fungible Tokens") are one-of-a-kind tokens that represent a unique good or asset, like digital art.
            They can be sold to collectors on various platforms, as well as they can be bought.</p><br /><br />

            <p class="text-2xl text-light mt-3">You can buy our NFTs in 3 different ways: the first one is to buy them through the private sale that we’ll be doing on Solanium.
                Then you can buy them through one of the private sales that we’ll be hosting on our website.
                At last, you can trade NFTs on marketplaces such as Solsea.</p><br /><br />
